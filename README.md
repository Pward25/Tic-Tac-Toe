# Overview

This project is a graphical Tic Tac Toe game built with Python and the Arcade library. As a software engineer, I created this game to deepen my understanding of game development, AI algorithms, and user interface design. The project allowed me to explore object-oriented programming concepts, implement the minimax algorithm for AI opponents, and create an interactive gaming experience with visual and audio feedback.

## How to Play

The game offers four different modes:
- **Player vs Player**: Two players take turns on the same computer
- **Easy Mode**: Play against a computer that makes random moves
- **Medium Mode**: Face a computer that plays strategically 50% of the time
- **Hard Mode**: Challenge yourself against an unbeatable AI using the minimax algorithm

To play, simply click on any empty cell to place your mark. Players alternate between X (blue) and O (red). The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Purpose

I wrote this software to enhance my skills in several key areas:
- Game development and interactive application design
- Implementing artificial intelligence algorithms (minimax with alpha-beta pruning)
- Working with graphics libraries and event-driven programming
- Creating responsive user interfaces with menu systems
- Integrating multimedia elements like sound effects

# Development Environment

**Tools Used:**
- Python 3.x
- Visual Studio Code / PyCharm (or your preferred IDE)
- Git for version control
- GitHub for project hosting

**Programming Language and Libraries:**
- **Python**: The core programming language
- **Arcade Library**: A modern Python framework for creating 2D games with built-in support for graphics, sound, and user input
- **Random Module**: For implementing random AI moves in easy and medium difficulty modes

# Future Work

* Implement a scoring system to track wins/losses/draws across multiple games
* Add highlight effects for the winning combination of three marks
* Create difficulty settings that can be adjusted mid-game
* Add game statistics and analytics (average moves per game, win rates, etc.)
